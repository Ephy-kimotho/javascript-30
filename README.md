# JavaScript 30 Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript 30** challenge repo!  
This project is part of the #JavaScript30 series by [Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/), a 30-day coding challenge focused on building fun, interactive projects using **vanilla JavaScript**—no frameworks, no libraries, no compilers.

## 🎯 Goal

The purpose of this challenge is to:

- Deepen my understanding of core JavaScript (DOM, events, functions, arrays, objects, etc.)
- Build muscle memory through daily hands-on coding
- Improve problem-solving and UI interaction skills
- Share my progress publicly and inspire other developers

Each project is built from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and is contained in its own folder for easy access and deployment.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder contains:

- `index.html` — The main HTML file
- `style.css` — The project’s styling
- `script.js` — All the JavaScript logic

## You can view each project live via the links below.
